WEEK 1 (Beginner level) - Getting started with HTML: 05 - 12 May 2025
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Section 1: Getting Started with HTML
        - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup language, and is used for structuring and presenting content on websites.
        - The current version is HTML5. HTML versions are standardized by an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        - Benefits of HTML 5
            1. HTML5 provides support for the latest multimedia
            2. It is easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
            3. Many features of HTML5 have been built to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
            4. HTML5 is a good language to develop cross-platform mobile applications (applications that work on various devices running various operating systems, such as iOS and Android).
        - The file extensions used for your webpages are .html or .htm
    - Section 2: Working with images
        - In HTML images are defined with the Image tag.
        - The Image tag contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
        - The src attribute defines the url (web address) of the image. You can use PNG, JPEG or GIF image files. Make sure you specify the correct image file name in the src attribute.
    - Section 3: Hyperlinks
        - A hyperlink is a text or an image you can click on, and jump to another page, website or document.
        - In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag
        - The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.itvarsity.org)
        - The link text is the visible part (visit our website)
        - Linking an item within the project is called internal linking

WEEK 2 (Beginner level) - Introduction to CSS: 12 - 19 May 2025
---------------------------------------------------------------
    - Section 1: Getting started with CSS
        - Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a simple design language that we use to make web pages beautiful and presentable.
        - Using CSS, you can set the colours, fonts and background images.
        - CSS is different from HTML, and they both serve completely different functions. Using HTML you create the structure of your page, and with CSS you add colors and styles to your page.
        - Benefits of CSS
            - CSS helps your pages load faster
            - CSS saves time
            - CSS makes maintaining a site easy
        - A div box acts like a container on your page. It limits styles to a specific area on the screen and prevents these styles from being applied elsewhere.
        - We add a DIV box to our page using the <div> tag.
        - The <div> tag must be given an id or a class name. Our CSS will identify a div box by its id or class name.
    - Section 2: Superhero app
        - Practical work section

    - Finished the 'Pine City Zoo' application

WEEK 4 (Beginner level) - Back-end: 26 May - 02 Jun 2025
--------------------------------------------------------
    - Section 1: JavaScript Basics
        - HTML is used to build the skeleton of any web page or app. CSS is used to improve the appearance of the page.
        - JavaScript is employed to give added functionality to a webpage or app and make it more dynamic.
        - Variables are storage containers that can store information away to be used later.
        - "if" and "else" statements. These are used for conditional statements
        - Functions are a set of instructions that are grouped together and giving a name
        - Parameters allow you to feed data into a function to be processed.
        - Variable scope is where a variable is usable and where it is inaccessible.
        - The switch statement works very similarly to the "if" statement, except the "switch" statement can  handle multiple options.
